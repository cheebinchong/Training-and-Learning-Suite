  // This Grunt plugin is part of the default asset pipeline in Sails,
  // so it's already been automatically loaded for you at this point.
  //
  // Of course, you can always remove this Grunt plugin altogether by
  // deleting this file.  But check this out: you can also use your
  // _own_ custom version of this Grunt plugin.
  //
  // Here's how:
  //
  // 1. Install it as a local dependency of your Sails app:
  //    ```
  //    $ npm install grunt-sync --save-dev --save-exact
  //    ```
  //
  //
  // 2. Then uncomment the following code:
  //
  // ```
  // // Load Grunt plugin from the node_modules/ folder.
  // grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-sync');
  // ```
